
Variables  in JS

	3 possible keywords to define in javascript variables.(Introduced in ES6)
	1) var -  We can resassign value if we use var keywords
	Example
	var name = "Akash";
	console.log(name); //Akash
	name = "Ashish";
	console.log(name); //Ashish
	
	
	2) let - let works similarly as var but it has advantage of block level scope.
	Example
	let name = "Akash";
	console.log(name); //Akash
	name = "Ashish";
	console.log(name); //Ashish
	
	
	3) const - const is used for constant. We cannot reassign value.
	Example
	const name = "Akash";
	console.log(name); // Akash
	name = "Ashish";
	console.log(name); // Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
	
	let and const have advantage of block level scope.
	Note :- String can be single quotes or double quotes.
	Variables must include letters, numbers, underscore and dollar sign.
	
	Note - 
	We can change the value of object but cannot the object completely
	Eg :-
	
	console.log(person); //{name: 'Akash', age: 30}
	person.name = "Sam";
	console.log(person); //{name: 'Sam', age: 30}
